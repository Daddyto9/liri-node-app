Homework assignment

We are creating an app that will ask the user for input in order to use the input to populate the parameters of a query that will pull 
data from an outside database. 

We will pull from four different API's including Spotify, OMDB, and Bands in town.

The idea is that the user will be asked if the would like information on any particular song, movie, band. The user will choose from a list, and that response from the user will trigger the appropiate API call based on that choice using the switch statement. Once the user selects from the list, then the user will be prompted to input which song, movie, or band they want information on.

The application will call on the API and retrieve information on the choice. 

In this application we are going to retrieve data from outside databases using axios.
